Exercise in scraping of PyPI's simple API:
1. Parse it using a Python script and extract some fun facts:

   - Number of packages with `python` in their name
   - ???
2. Once I'm comfortable, fit everything in a Jupyter notebook because why not

# Setup

```bash
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.xt
```
